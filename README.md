# AVLvisualizer
Highly detailed AVL visualizer that accepts insertions and deletions with the detection of rotations and re-blance.

This project departs from the initial work of Vileend, a programmer that created the insertions version of the AVL.

In this new version, I've also implemented deletions, which is able to detect and note the rotations that may occur while deleting a node.

`New`: Added a console log that tracks all movements and displays them on a console.

Done with `HTML`, `CSS` and `Javascript`.
